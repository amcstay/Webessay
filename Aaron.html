    <p>Do you need to make it to the big league to be successful?
    Do you need to work for a big company to have a successful career in graphic design, there is no definite answer for this question as it depends on what the artist themselves feels success is to them; some people want to climb a corporate ladder whilst others find happiness in a small business or self-employment. What we view as success is usually making it big in a company however looking at Aaron Draplin who took the risk to go solo and has been greatly successful in doing so. Looking at how he was able to achieve this, his outlook on his choice and his advice to any graphic designer out there.

    <P>Mrs Eaves is named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville's wife. As Baskerville was setting up his printing and type business, Mrs. Eaves moved in with him as a live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his wife after the death of her first husband, Mr. Eaves. Mrs Eaves is a revival of the types of English printer and punch-cutter John Baskerville and is related to contemporary Baskerville typefaces.
        Like Baskerville, Mrs Eaves, cut by Zuzana Licko of Émigré, has a near vertical stress, departing from the Old-Style model. Identifying characters, similar to Baskerville's types, are the lowercase g with its open lower counter and swash-like ear. Both the roman and italic uppercase Q have a flowing swash-like tail. The uppercase C has serifs at top and bottom; there is no serif at the apex of the central junction in uppercase W; and the uppercase G has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial serif.</P>
