    <h2 id="intro">Indroduction</h2>

    <p>Do you need to work for a big company to have a successful career in graphic design? There is no definite answer for this question as it depends on what the artist themselves feels success is to them; some people want to climb a corporate ladder whilst others find happiness in a small business or self-employment. What we view as success is usually making it big in a company however, we need to consider, graphic designers, such as Aaron Draplin, who took the risk to go solo and has had great success in doing so. Focusing in on how he was able to achieve this, his outlook on his choice and his advice to any graphic designer out there. We explore the idea of being an independent graphic designer.

        <div class="column middle">
    <p style="color: #323232"> Aaron Draplin is an American Graphic Design and entrepreneur based in Portland, Oregon. He grew up in Traverse city, Michigan and when he was 17, he began an associate degree at North-western Michigan College; then at 19 he went with friend to pursue snowboarding and after five years he decided to finish his design degree in 1998, at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, earning a bachelor’s in graphic design. From here he joined a snowboarding magazine in California and worked there for two years before accepting a job as a senior designer in Cinco Design Office of Portland. This is where he worked with bigger clients such as Nike, Ford Motor Company and the Obama Administration and earning a good name for himself. However, he only worked at this job for two years as well, then took a massive risk in pursuing a self-employed career in 2004. And in his luck his career took off successfully.[1]</p>

        <div class="column middle"> 
    <P>Glancing through Draplin’s work [5], you see that most of his work involves designing logos for companies etc. and from first impressions you can see that it’s very clean and simple making it very suitable for clients to use in a range of mediums, such as signs, prints, vehicles, and merchandise, and this is something Aaron thrives to achieve, as he explains in a video[6] where he was challenged to create a logo, he goes through his process of how he work, and during this you can witness how he passionate he is about his work. Draplin loves to take inspiration from vintage branding and many old graphic design books, that he enjoys flicking through. Furthermore, like any good designer, its always paper and pen first and he comes up sketches from his initial inspiration before taking to digital formatting and then finding what’s prefect from there. A good tip I receive from the challenge video [6] was to save each instance of the design; so that you can see what worked and what didn’t, and this is something any designer should do when working digital. <br><br>
        What I noticed from looking at his work is that Draplin lines to use thick outlines/lines which generally seem to always bee the same width, and this tells me that from his experience in the field that this is the prefect line width for him to use in personal projects and for clients. Apart from the client work that he does, Draplin also has his own merch store [7] where he gets to incorporate his love for retro style or at least more than he can when working with clients. In his merch work you notice that Draplin tends to use certain range colours throughout each launch of merch work, however he does gravitate towards oranges more. This stand out as something important that graphic designers that want to go independent need to do, as your work needs to be unique and stand out against competing companies,  however it can be very difficult to do something original as many things have already been done, hence why Draplin himself loves to take refence from old material as that it a style that worked in the past and can still be used in the modern day, without feeling outdated. Apart from the merch, Draplin is also owner of a business called Fieldnotes [8], which Draplin explores a different style that he would be known for; field notes take inspiration from vintage designs such as traditional memo books, that would have been distributed to American farmers and other agricultural companies over the last hundred years.

          <h3>Going self employed</h3> </div> 
          <div class="column middle">
      <p> Draplin knew that the corporate lifestyle didn’t suit him, however he continued to work there to save money, so that he knew that he would be in a stable situation once he eventually would become independent. Going freelance isn’t something that you can do right off the bat, Draplin even stated that find getting a degree pointless but for stepping into the industry it’s the best gateway, as the experience from working in a company is essentially before going freelance [2]. Many graphic designers dream of going freelance and think they can just take the risk, however even Draplin was 31 when he went freelance, and he was fortunate enough to be in that position through years of work and preparation. Not everyone has that kind of luck and work motive in them. Even now when he is viewed as successful Draplin is still constantly working threw out the day, on plane rides, late at night, he is constantly working hard [2], as to be a successful freelancer you need to have complete passion and dedication to the work, so much so that it becomes your whole world as that’s how you find success in competing against big companies.</p>

<h3 id="bio">Advice</h3> </div>
<div class="column middle"> 
<P>In many articles, talks etc, Aaron gives advice on how he was able to make his career successful, with his main point being to get ahead [2]. In his talk with Chris from The Futur [2] he mentions that even when working for the companies he did, he stated he always worked far into the night past after everyone else would have clocked off, one of the things he likes about being an entrepreneur was the ability to work to the earlier hour in the mornings, with this he felt that 9 to 5 was pointless cause he could get much more done if he just remained at home [2][3] hence that’s exactly what he did.
    Aaron has given many talks and classes that he gives that can help other graphic designers a chance to learn how he does things or learn things that they may have never been taught or told whilst in class or in the industry. Here are ten pieces of advice, that Draplin has given from several sources all which I had found on the Skillshare website had summed up perfectly. [4]
     </P>
 <blockquote> <li>Work ethic is everything</li> 
  <li> Remember to have fun</li> 
  <li> Don’t be afraid to go it alone</li> 
  <li> Let your clients lead the way</li> 
  <li> Reduce your overhead</li> 
  <li> Design logos for scalability  </li> 
  <li> Less is usually more</li> 
  <li> Don’t bombard your clients with options</li> 
  <li> Gain new clients through public speaking</li> </blockquote>
  <br>
   <p>These tips cover how to work solo in the industry, tips about creating designs and how to deal with clients, these are tip that are useful for any graphic designer, but do tend to be more helpful towards designers looking to do freelance, as when working for a company there’s more of a chance that a whole team is working on the project, so the tasks are split up, whereas with freelance its basically all on themselves to figure out. Some people may thrive having this control over everything and this may make them feel successful as they’ve done it themselves however others may find working with a team at a corporation may be more awarding as they can focus on their own task and find success in that.  </P>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
        <p>So, do you need to make it to the big league to be successful? The answer for this question would generally be no, however this depends on how each individual perceives successful. All designers have their own personal goals that they thrive towards, some may aim lower than others however this is what works for them, and this is what success is to them; as they grow these goals may aim bigger, however for each goal they achieve they may take it as success. Some people will aim for the big league as will only find themselves successful when they hit that goal. Correspondingly, do you need to work for a big company to have a successful career? Technically as we’ve explored with Aaron Draplin the answer is yes, however as I was researching further into Draplin, I found that being an independent designer isn’t something that everyone can pull off successfully, and here’s why. Many graphic designers love what they do and are good at their jobs, however after looking at Draplin’s journey and work, I would say not everyone has the ever-loving passion for it. Draplin can risk everything and put his entire life into pursing his passion and still love every moment of his work, whereas I feel a lot of people wouldn’t be excited for every project and end up just doing the work they have to, without putting their passion into it. Hence why I don’t think everyone is capable of finding great success in being independent, as I feel overtime some may come to hate having their whole lives revolve around their career. So, in conclusion success is different for everyone, whether it’s big or small.
